## [8.0.2] - 2025-09-05

### Changed

-   Legends with LUT are now default positioned on right side of chart rather than bottom.
    - This was done because Legend LUTs don't look very good in horizontal orientation
-   `ZoomBandChart` now automatically copies secondary axis type (linear, high precision, logarithmic)
-   Changed `DataSetXY` to allow schema entry being `undefined`

-   Fixed scrolling heatmap grid series working incorrectly if `setStart` is called when the series has data inside it
-   Fixed `DataSetXY.appendSamples` crashing if data record has key with `undefined` value

## [8.0.1] - 2025-08-20

### Added

-   Added support for `DataSetXY.appendJSON` as list of tuples

### Fixed

-   Fixed `ChartXY` axis rectangle zoom interaction sometimes prevents panning interaction from working (and other similar situations)
-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` bug that can happen when FPS is very low. When dragging time window knobs, 'click' interaction can fire after drag interaction is finished.
-   Fixed `DataSetXY.appendJSON` color input not working
-   Fixed `scaleTheme` not working

## [8.0.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added

-   Added point stroke style APIs to XY point series, Polar point series, buttons, legend entries and cursor point markers
    -   Allows drawing line stroke along edges of points.
    -   For example, `PointLineAreaSeries.setPointStrokeStyle`
-   Added `ChartWithCursor.setCursorDynamicBehavior`
-   Added new `ChartXY` axis title position option: `"center-chart"`
    -   Positions axis title to center of whole chart, rather than center of the axis only.
    -   Useful for aligning axis title nicely relative to chart title or legend
-   Added `HighlightModes.onHoverIndividual`
    -   Relevant only for `FigureSeries`, allowing individual highlighting of figure that is under pointer.
-   Added `LUT.formatter`
    -   New convenient way to specify formatting rules for LUT values, affecting both cursors and legends at once.
-   Added `Axis` support for negative tick lengths and paddings + new label alignment option, effectively adding support for inverted axis labels (displayed inside series area rather than outside)

### Changed

-   Reworked legends.
    -   For more information and migration instructions, please read migration guide in developer documentation.
-   Changed `DataSetXY` and `PointLineAreaSeries` APIs to allow more functionalities and optimizations.
    -   Please read migration guide for more detailed information.
-   Changed `ChartXY.addLineSeries`, `addPointSeries`, `addPointLineSeries`, `addStepSeries`, `addSplineSeries`, `addAreaSeries` to return `PointLineAreaSeries` instead of previous deprecated series.
    -   More details can be found in migration guide.
-   Significant CPU performance optimizations for scrolling or otherwise updating ChartXY applications.
-   Point series now draw borders around points by default.
    -   Previous behavior can be restored with `PointLineAreaSeries.setPointStrokeStyle(emptyLine)`
-   Improved default cursor auto fitting to work better with small charts.
-   Series entries in legends and cursor result tables now include borders.
-   Reworked default cursor point marker styles.
-   Changed default `ChartXY` axis title position from `"center"` to `"center-chart"`
    -   This change is only applied for axes that don't have any stacks (several axes adjacent to each other)
-   Improved Funnel and Pyramid chart label positioning
-   Default cursor formatters no longer display "X" or "Y" in case of axis without titles.
-   Optimized loading speed and memory consumption of majority of 3D series by ~20%
-   Wrapped `Axis.addBand` parameter to an object parameter. See migration guide for more details.
-   Wrapped `Axis.addConstantLine` parameter to an object parameter. See migration guide for more details.
-   Slightly changed default positioning of X axis titles in `ChartXY`
    -   Changed from "center of axis" to "center of chart" to better align with new legends and chart titles.
    -   Previous behavior can be restored with `chart.axisX.setTitlePosition('center')`
-   Added few new required properties to `Theme` definition
-   Tweaked built-in cursor formatting in situations with only 1 series with some data pattern. Previously shown like "series, x, y" now shown with same pattern as when there are several series "x, series: y" to avoid discrepancies between the two common scenarios

### Removed

-   Removed `AxisScrollStrategies.regressive`, `fittingStart`, `fittingEnd`
    -   See migration guide for more details.
-   Removed `Cursor.setAutoFitStrategy`, `AutoFitStrategy`, `AutoFitStrategyFactory`, `AutoFitStrategies`
    -   These APIs were simplified to just a boolean flag "auto fit enabled" on cursors.
-   Removed

## [7.1.2] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed

-   Fix performance issue when interacting on one ChartXY axis, then creating a new axis and interacting with it

## [7.1.1] - 2025-05-07

### Fixed

-   Fixed "License invalid" error sometimes produced even though license is valid.

## [7.1.0] - 2025-05-07

### Added

-   Added `scaleThemeFontSize`
    -   Convenience function to up or downscale font sizes as well as tick lengths, element paddings, etc. to make font sizes sit in nicely.
-   Added `Axis.getSeriesDataRange`
    -   Quality of life method to get data extents of all series attached to an Axis
-   Added new capabilities to `AxisScrollStrategies`.
    -   For `fitting`, `expansion` and `fittingStepped` you can now specify whether it should affect axis start and/or end. By default affects both sides.
    -   Added `scrolling`. This is the replacement to now deprecated `progressive` and `regressive`. It also has a new feature for real-time scrolling in use cases where data arrives infrequently (every 1s etc.)
-   Introduced HTML text rendering option (beta)
    -   Can be enabled for sharper text display where required with drawback of weaker performance.
    -   For more information refer to HTML text rendering section in developer documentation.

    -   `chart`
    -   Some events to `addEventListener`
-   Added optional `skipIntervalRestrictions` parameter to `Axis.setDefaultInterval`
    -   Situationally useful as previously setting axis default interval always ignored any interval restrictions

### Changed

-   Improved zoom capabilities of `AxisTickStrategies.DateTime`
    -   Now allows zooming up to individual nanoseconds.
    -   Nanosecond timestamps must be loaded to charts as Float64 after shifting to start from 0 and converting to milliseconds.
-   Improved radial gradient quality
-   Domain locked license keys now allow running charts inside same origin iframes
-   LightningChart JS now adds `overflow: hidden` to its container DIV style always.

-   Fixed `Axis.setTitleRotation` sometimes not updating title display.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` render error when zoomed out and coordinates are larger than 10^16
-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` not automatically adjusting if connected to an inverted axis.
-   Fixed `PyramidChart`, `PieChart`, `FunnelChart` not being able to display negative values.

    -   `AxisScrollStrategy` -> `AxisScrollStrategyNew`
    -   `AxisScrollStrategies.progressive` -> `AxisScrollStrategies.scrolling`
    -   `AxisScrollStrategies.regressive` -> `AxisScrollStrategies.scrolling({ progressive: false })`
    -   `AxisScrollStrategies.fittingStart` -> `AxisScrollStrategies.fitting({ end: false })`
    -   `AxisScrollStrategies.fittingEnd` -> `AxisScrollStrategies.fitting({ start: false })`
-   Deprecated `Axis.setAutoRegionsEnabled` in favour of `Axis.setScrollMargins`

## [7.0.4] - 2025-04-24

### Changed

-   Disabled `ChartXY` paginate user interaction by default always.

### Fixed

-   Fixed `'click'` events not firing on touch devices
-   Fixed cursor sometimes not displaying pointed data point color of `PointLineAreaSeries`
-   Fixed `Axis.setThickness` sometimes not updating the chart layout immediately
-   Fixed `ChartXY` parallel axis ticks sometimes overlapping after mouse wheel or other operation
-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` aligning itself to hidden axes
-   Fixed `ChartXY` manual cursor gridlines randomly not being shown when positioning them on user interaction

## [7.0.3] - 2025-03-25

### Added

-   Added Uint32 precision to `MeshModel3D.setModelGeometry` indices. Previously only Uint16 was available.

### Changed

-   Reverted change introduced in v7.0.0 where important default CSS values for chart container DIV where applied only if computed style didn't have any value.
    -   This approach was not valid and resulted in these configurations never being applied.
    -   Comparing to previous v7.0.x versions, this can show as different CSS for touch-action, position and box-sizing properties. If you want to override their default values, use !important syntax.

### Fixed

-   Fixed numeric tick placement bug when extreme ticks are enabled and axis is physically very small, where major and extreme ticks could overlap.
-   Fixed a performance degradation on `PointLineAreaSeries`
-   Fixed `PointSeries3D` crash when changing from simple shading style to phong shading
-   Fixed `BoxSeries3D` not working when fill style was `PalettedFill` with `'value'` look up property.
-   Fixed chart resize flickering when using individual canvas mode

## [7.0.2] - 2025-02-18

### Added

-   Added `BarChart.setLabelFittingMargins`
    -   Allows controlling spacing of bar chart labels when auto fitting is enabled.
-   Added `DataSetXYOptions.includesNaN`
    -   Can be set to `false` if you know that data will never include NaN values for slight performance increase.

### Removed

-   Removed `ConstantLine.setInteractionMoveByDragging`
    -   This was supposed to have been removed already in v7.0.1. It was replaced by `setUserInteractions`

### Fixed

-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` with ProgressiveX pattern points appearing too early in applications with large data gaps.
-   Fixed creating UI `ButtonBox` resulting in crash.
-   Fixed interaction APIs missing from `PointMarker`
-   Fixed `BarChart` positive and negative variants rendering being cut off.
-   Fixed `BarChart` value axis title sometimes mispositioned for 1 frame or until chart is interacted with.
-   Fixed cursor showing white color sometimes when pointing at dynamically colored series.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` sometimes not displaying anything when data set contains a lot of data gaps (`NaN`) and view is zoomed out.
-   Fixed `ChartXY` axis title position being off on 1st frame
-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` sometimes not aligning itself to attached charts until interacted with.

## [7.0.1] - 2025-02-05

### Added

-   **Added rounded corners**. Enabled by default.
    -   Reverting back to non-rounded corners can be done by setting `Theme.legendBorderRadius` / `Theme.cursorResultTableBorderRadius` to `undefined`
-   **Added `TextSeries`**
    -   New powerful and more convenient feature for displaying text objects inside `ChartXY`
    -   Compared to old approach of using UI elements, is more performant, supports clipping text outside axis view and exposes handy methods for interacting with text boundaries and size.
-   Added text shadows (beta)
    -   Improves text readability by displaying a different colored shadow under it
    -   For dark built-in Themes enabled by default. Can be disabled with `disableTextShadows`
-   Added high precision axis support to XY heatmap series.
    -   This makes using heatmaps in time series applications that require zooming up to hours, minutes, seconds or lower significantly easier.
-   Added new `PointLineAreaSeries.solveNearest` signature
    -   Allows solving nearest data point from an axis coordinate, rather than client coordinate
-   Added ability to style cursor row backgrounds separately to highlight headers or other rows
    -   For demonstration, see cursors in online examples.
    -   Can be used via default cursor formatters or by using `rowFillStyle` property from `ResultTableCellContent`
-   Added ability for cursors to display the color of pointed data point even in dynamically colored applications (such as heatmaps, color look up, etc.)
    -   Can be used via default cursor formatters or with `useCursorDataPointColor`.
-   Added `SurfaceScrollingGridSeries3D.invalidateValues, getSampleCount`
    -   Equivalent API that was previously introduced for 2D heatmap series to be used in time-series applications.
-   Added `ChartXYLayoutChangedEvent`, `ChartXY.getLayout`
    -   These are new function concepts aimed to help with static aspect ratio apps and other use cases that require knowing the dimensions of ChartXY axis sizes, viewport sizes, etc.
    -   Released as @beta - the APIs might change based on user feedback.
-   Added `MeshModel3D.setModelFromObj`
    -   Built-in OBJ parsing was implemented due to issues of open source alternatives not loading many files properly.
    -   Compared to before also supports automatic normal calculation if missing from source.
-   Added `undefined` parameter option to `Axis.setIntervalRestrictions` for removing any previously added restriction
-   Added `Axis.setHighlightOnHover`, `Axis.getHighlightOnHover`
-   Added couple new experimental scroll strategy options
    -   `AxisScrollStrategies.fittingStart`, `fittingEnd`, `nextPowerOf10`
-   Added ability to control text font and fillstyle even when supplying a `Series` or other chart component to cursor result table content. This was previously not possible
-   Added `Axis.isX`, `isY`
    -   Simple convenience flags for end user utilization
-   Added `MeshModel3D.setModelMaterial`
    -   Allows reading .mtl (material) files for per-part coloring and shading.
-   Added new "stacked sum label" functionality to BarChart (stacked variant)
    -   Enabled by default. Shows the sum of all subcategory values of a category.
    -   Please see migration guide if you want to restore previous behavior.
-   Added `PolarAxisRadial.setMarginAfterTicks`

### Changed

-   **`ChartXY` axis by default sets interval restriction to prevent zooming outside attached data.**
    -   Can be reverted using `Axis.setIntervalRestrictions(undefined)`
    -   This behavior is also automatically disabled if axis interval is explicitly configured in application code.
-   **Reworked all user interaction APIs.**
    -   For more information, see migration guide.
-   **Reworked all Event APIs.**
    -   For more information see migration guide
-   **`ChartXY` Axes now automatically ensure that their tick labels don't leak outside the axis bounds** (for example, outside chart render area or inside other stacked axes)
    -   Previous behavior can be restored with `Axis.setKeepTickLabelsInAxisBounds`
    -   This change makes it easier to fit charts into small containers without having to be afraid of labels cutting off. For this reason, the default `right` padding of ChartXY has been reduced from 24 to 15 pixels.
-   **Various improvements to built-in tick placement behavior**
    -   Prevent situations where there is only 1 tick visible
    -   Prevent situations where there are too many ticks visible, resulting in cluttered look
    -   Improved readability of date-time and time minor ticks
    -   Fix situations where chart layout would be slightly off during 1st displayed frame
    -   Performance improvements from reduced number of ticks in many cases
-   LightningChart JS now adds `touch-action: none` to its container div style when a chart is created
    -   This is required for touch interactions to work as expected.
    -   As a side effect, native touch interactions such as scrolling page up/down no longer work when interacting directly on the charts.
    -   Previous behavior can be restored by adding CSS `touch-action: auto` to the container div
-   `AxisTickStrategies.DateTime` now defaults to great ticks disabled.
    -   These refer to additional labels that display year or month on certain zoom levels.
    -   Previous behavior can be restored with `chart.axisX.setTickStrategy(AxisTickStrategies.DateTime, (strategy) => strategy.setGreatTickStyle(strategy.getMajorTickStyle().setTickLength(28).setTickStyle(emptyLine)))`
-   Reworked `appendJSON` method type definition to be more relaxed.
    -   Issue previously was that some specific TypeScript syntaxes did not satisfy the type even though the idea was completely valid.
-   Removed dependency to `@lightningchart/eventer`
-   Reworked `SpiderChart`
    -   Supports different axis intervals within a single chart.
    -   Chart will automatically scale and format axis intervals if not overridden.
    -   Please refer to migration guide for full changelog.
-   Changed `Band` default `valueEnd` value from `0` to `1`
-   Changed default button look slightly (legends/cursors)
    -   Now vertical linear gradient instead of previous radial gradient
-   Improved BarChart label fitting algorithm to display labels more aggressively as long as they don't collide with other labels
-   Type changes to `BarChartValueLabels` and `BarChartLabelFormatter` to accommodate new functionality of displaying stack sum labels.
    -   Please see migration guide for details.
-   Changed type definition of `FormattingRange`
    -   Previous type definition was unnecessarily complicated. This is a backwards incompatible change, more information can be found in migration guide.
-   Changed `AxisTickStrategies.Numeric` extreme tick placement behavior slightly. It now ignores axis regions always, meaning extreme ticks may be a few pixels away from visible axis start/end.
    -   Change was made for manual configured axis interval use cases as otherwise extreme ticks would display different values than configured extremes
-   Slightly changed progressive `DataSetXY` behavior. Now later coordinate having same value as previous is accepted. Previously had to be at least slightly larger (or smaller depending on pattern)
-   `PolarChart` radial axis ticks are no longer hidden when they are positioned where radial axis title would be, if axis title is hidden
-   Changed `PolarAreaSeries.setConnectDataAutomaticallyEnabled(true)` behavior. Removed amplitude interpolation, now directly connected to first data point.

### Removed

-   Removed `Figure.getBoundaries`
    -   The method was widely unused and misleading. It was mainly introduced for internal purposes but accidentally included in end user API
-   Removed `MapChart.getRegionUnderMouse`
    -   Replaced by `MapChart.regions` which allows following interactions above all MapChart regions
-   Removed `isDateTimeTickStrategy`, `isNumericTickStrategy`, `isTimeTickStrategy`, `isEmptyTickStrategy`
    -   These did not work and there is no identified use case for them even if they did work

### Fixed

-   Fixed `ChartXY` animated zoom to fit sometimes resulting in first X axis animation and only afterwards Y axis animation
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries.getYMin, getYMax, getXMin, getXMax` not returning up to date value when used immediately after data is pushed in.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries.getYMin`, `getYMax`, `getXMin`, `getXMax` returning only visible data ranges rather than full data set ranges.
    -   For example, for case ProgressiveX, if only part of series was visible `getYMax` would only consider data points that are visible.
-   Fixed `AxisTickStrategies.Time` displaying milliseconds in major ticks at ~10 second time interval.
    -   Completely redundant information because every major tick is displayed at :000
-   Improved chart position tracking on scrollable web pages to alleviate issues where chart would not be interactable after its position would be changed.
    -   https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/docs/troubleshooting/chart-is-not-interactable/
-   Fixed theme effect leaking incorrectly inside `DataGrid`
-   Fix `ParallelCoordinateChart` series also rendered outside series area if axis interval is manually set
-   Fixed `BarChart` axes not visible when no data present.
-   Fixed `ParallelCoordinateChart.setCustomCursor` and cursor target change event not working.
-   Fixed bug where hovering mouse over `PointLineAreaSeries` with data gaps could break cursor result table from being displayed.
-   Fixed minor memory leak in `ChartXY`
-   Fixed minor performance overhead in `PointLineAreaSeries` when points rendering is enabled.
-   Fixed `PolarSector` angle restrictions preventing for example displaying a sector from 350 deg to 10 deg.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` render error where entire series could temporarily be invisible.
    -   Happened in very specific circumstances, where there was a large gap between two data points and zoom level was changed very particularly.
-   Fix `PointLineAreaSeries` not working properly with `RegressiveY` data pattern in scrolling applications.
-   Fixed performance issue on inverted `ChartXY` axes (end < start). Caused chart to re-render even though nothing had changed.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` render error where line trend would ignore actual data provided and draw a straight line.
    -   Happened in streaming applications with very time-specific zoom level changes.
-   Fixed all LCJS chart types assigning `position` and `boxSizing` CSS properties to container DIV even if they are explicitly defined in user applications CSS.
-   Fixed FPS problem when using `GaugeChart` with small container size
-   Fixed incorrect `GaugeChart` unit label position when animations are disabled.
-   Fixed some glow effect rendering issues related to browser zooming.
-   Fixed incorrect data gap rendering for `PointLineAreaSeries` with spline
    -   Some segments were not rendered

-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` crash when adding series with options `xAxis` or `yAxis`
-   Fixed `ParallelCoordinateChart` series also rendered outside series area if axis interval is manually set
-   Fixed `BarChart` (stacked and grouped) crash if legend is recreated and highlighting is enabled
-   Improved v6.1.0 workaround for Intel Iris Xe and Apple Silicon Chip M1/M2/M3 graphics error
    -   Issue was still visible when using rotated series (e.g. high precision Y axis)
-   Fixed Polar chart radial axis tick labels being hidden around where axis title would be, even if title is hidden.

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `PointLineAreaSeries.add` and `addArraysXY`.
    -   Replacements `appendJSON` and ´appendSamples` were already added almost year before but due to build error, deprecation was not marked correctly.

## [6.1.1] - 2024-11-19

### Fixed

    -   Slight behavior improvement in stacked axis use cases with HTML overlays between axes
-   Added `MeshModel3D.setModelRotationQuaternion`

### Changed

-   LightningChart JS now falls back to a publicly hosted asset folder when using select features (zoom band chart, map chart, some themes, onscreen menu)
    -   This mainly helps resolve some visual issues when crafting very first prototypes with LCJS. Does not affect existing production applications.
-   Changed return type of `Axis.getIntervalRestrictions`
    -   Before returned exact value set by user, which could be a generally useless callback function.
    -   Now returns currently active axis restrictions.
-   Supplying XY data points as `String` numbers now throws an error.
    -   Previously, the data visualization "might" be correct, but for example, cursors would often not work, or the visualization might randomly disappear.
    -   Input as `String` numbers has NEVER been supported, but during the years has lead to difficult bugs in user applications.
-   `ChartXY.getAxes` now sorts results based on `iStack`
    -   Returned axes are always in increasing `iStack` order
-   Slightly modified cursor auto fit behavior
    -   Previously cursor was flipped if it would extend outside series area
    -   Now cursor is flipped if it would extend outside chart container
-   `Axis.setDefaultInterval` with callback option is now not triggered before some attached series has data
    -   This seemingly small change fixes some normal applications of default intervals that didn't function before
-   Improved logarithmic axis minimum interval limit (smallest displayed value)

### Fixed

-   Worked around Apple Silicon Chip M1/M2/M3 issues with High precision axis feature
    -   With this specific hardware the high precision axis rendering did not work (result was same as with normal axis)
-   Worked around Intel Iris Xe issues with High precision axis feature
    -   With this specific hardware the high precision axis rendering did not work (lines appeared all janky and jumping all over the place)
-   Fixed effect rendering issue with horizontal bar charts.
-   Fixed grouped bar chart not displaying all sub categories if sorting is disabled after inputting data
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` not rendering markers when area and stroke is disabled and data is progressive and view is zoomed out
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` not working with inverted X axis
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` area gradient behaving unexpectedly with inverted Y axis
-   Fixed cursor point markers having higher draw order than result tables
-   Fixed `TreeMapChart` flat coloring, instead of different depths having varying colors
-   Fixed logarithmic axis regions applied wrong
    -   Resulted in points being clipped by axis view, etc.
-   Fixed `GaugeChart` automatic color not applied if value is outside gauge interval range.
-   Fixed type error not allowing user to supply Colors with `appendJSON` methods.
-   Fixed `Chart3D.setProjection('orthographic')` still resulting in perspective projection
-   Fixed Polar heatmap sometimes crashing when accessing solve result properties in user interaction handlers along edges of heatmap.

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `LineSeries`, `PointSeries`, `PointLineSeries`, `StepSeries`, `SplineSeries`, `AreaSeries`
    -   This is part of a long term feature transition which started from v5.1.0 towards newer `PointLineAreaSeries`. At present time, `PointLineAreaSeries` should support all use cases of the older features, thus we deprecate the older features before finally removing them.
-   Deprecated `MeshModel3D.setModelRotation` over `setModelRotationEuler`

    -   Default mode was `false` instead of expected `true`
    -   `setClipping` did not do anything
-   Fixed `LineSeries` skipping rendering if its entirely outside its axis range, even when it should be visible in stacked axis use cases with clipping disabled

## [6.0.1] - 2024-08-13

### Added

-   Added `Band.setClipping`, `ConstantLine.setClipping`

### Changed

-   Added `ImageFill` support for `PointLineAreaSeries` and `PolarPointSeries` marker fill styles
    -   Allows displaying custom picture assets in axis coordinates with axis clipping.
-   Added `PointLineAreaSeries.setPointAlignment`, `getPointAlignment`
    -   Allows display of non-centered points. For example, position points by vertical bottom.

    -   Required for React applications which use shared LC context and include charts inside scrollable DIVs which are not the document body. Used to notify charts that their position on the webpage may have changed.
-   Added `ChartComponent.setIcon` (beta)
    -   This can be used to associate a chart component with a icon graphic. For many series types this results in automatically displaying that Icon in legends and cursors.
-   Added ability to use `Icon` anywhere `PointShape` can be used.
    -   XY point series, Polar point series, Point markers, Legend entries, Checkboxes
    -   Additionally, Icons can now be used as part of Result table content
-   Added `DataSetXY.fill`, `PointLineAreaSeries.fill` methods

-   Fixed long scroll animations in time-series use cases when first data points are added.
-   Fixed charts not following changes to window devicePixelRatio after chart is created
    -   This can be observed by text staying sharp and thicknesses/point sizes adjusting when using browser zooming
    -   Note that in order for this to work, web site needs to have meta tag meta[name="viewport"] width=device-width
-   Made `PointLineAreaSeries` more robust to common invalid data supply patterns in data streaming test setups.
    -   e.g. data points sharing same time coordinate, or even having slightly incorrect order.

### Fixed

-   Fixed ZoomBand Chart resources not included in package
-   Fixed crash when using sandbox licensing and initiating `lightningChart()` several times.

## [5.0.0] - 2023-11-08

### Added

-   Shared WebGL Context rendering.
    -   Removes the old 16 chart limit. Now you can have 1000+ charts on a single page depending on the hardware running the page.
    -   Has two modes:
        -    Individual canvas mode. In this mode each chart is render to it's own canvas. This is the default mode.
        -    Shared canvas mode. All charts are render to a single shared canvas. Can have better performance than the individual canvas mode.
    -   See Developer Documentation "Grouping charts" for more information
    -   Starting with LCJS v5.0.0, it's important to do only one call to the `lightningChart()` library entry point function. You should call this function once and create all of the charts from the same returned object
-   Added automatic sandbox licensing.
    -   When charts are used in specific, popular sandbox sites (like Stack Overflow, Codepen, JSFiddle), the charts work automatically, without passing any license.
-   New event `isInView`
    -   This event is triggered when a chart becomes visible in the browser viewport.
-   `dispose()` to the library entry point interface (`lightningChart()`)`
    -   This can be used to dispose the shared WebGL context and all charts that have been created with it.
-   Added option to have different fonts and fill styles within result table content.
    -   See changes to `ResultTableContent` and `TableContentBuilder.addRow`
-   Added `PointShape.Arrow`, `Cross`, `Diamond`, `Minus`, `Plus`, `Star`
-   Added `HeatmapScrollingGridSeriesIntensityValues.invalidateIntensityValues`, `getSampleCount` methods
    -   Allows backwards invalidation of previously added samples and pushing data by sample index.
    -   Directed to make heatmap time series applications more convenient.
-   Added `MapChart.getRegionUnderMouse`
-   Added `ResultTable.setPadding`, `ResultTable.getPadding`
-   Added auto cursors to `PieChart`, `FunnelChart` and `PyramidChart`
    -   New methods: `setAutoCursor`, `getAutoCursor`, `setAutoCursorMode`, `getAutoCursorMode`, `setCursorResultTableFormatter`
-   Added optional `matchStyleExactly` flag when adding components to legend box to match button color exactly to attached components rather than making default gradient
-   Added `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides.setLabelSliceOffset`, `getLabelSliceOffset`, `setLabelConnectorGapStart`, `getLabelConnectorGapStart`, `setLabelConnectorEndLength`, `getLabelConnectorEndLength`
-   Added option to `captureFrame` method to return the result as a Data URL.
    -   See LegendBoxAddOptions in API reference to learn more.
-   Added `UICheckBox.setTextFillStyleHidden`, `getTextFillStyleHidden` methods

### Changed

-   Changed non-commercial license terms
    -   Before, omitting license key meant approving to non-commercial use terms
    -   Now, license key is always required. Get a license at `https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/#license-key`
-   Reworked `OHLCSeries`.
    -   Performance massively improved. Loading time 40x faster, data capacity 200x more (average desktop GPU).
    -   See migration guide for instructions of using reworked feature.
-   Reworked `ZoomBandChart`
    -   The feature has been reimplemented from scratch with two goals: better UX + simpler API.
    -   See migration guide for details.
-   Refactored `FigureSeries` (`RectangleSeries`, `SegmentSeries`, `PolygonSeries`, `BoxSeries`, `EllipseSeries`)
    -   Main motivation to improve performance greatly, enabling use cases that need large numbers of figures.
    -   New implementation is much more performance efficient, on average ~50x more powerful or even more.
-   Changed visual look of `LegendBox` buttons.
    -   Now the text and button are dimmed when series is hidden, rather than the previous "check box ticked" approach.
-   Built-in `Themes` cursor gridstroke style changed to `DashedLine`
-   Changed interfaces around tick styles.
    -   `TickStyle` should now be only needed interface. It has all APIs necessary for styling axis ticks.
    -   `emptyTick` can be used as convenience to hide ticks completely.
    -   `VisibleTicks` and `EmptyTicks` classes are removed.
    -   When mutating a tick style, there is no longer a need to check `isVisibleTicks` in TypeScript applications.
    -   This should mainly remove type errors, rather than introduce them.
-   Changed `Theme` properties:
    -   Some deprecated `Theme` properties have been removed, and new ones introduced and made non-optional to accommodate for new features.
    -   For details, see migration guide.
-   `LegendBox` buttons now match the shape of attached point-based series.
    -   Concerns following series: `PointSeries`, `PointLineSeries`, `StepSeries`, `SplineSeries`, `PolarPointSeries`, `PolarPointLineSeries` and `SpiderSeries`.
    -   If this behavior is undesirable, it can be prevented like: `LegendBox.add(component, { builder: UIElementBuilders.CheckBox })`
    -   This also let's you choose any shape from `PointShape` collection. See `LegendBoxAddOptions` in API reference for more information.
-   Changed parameters of `onHighlight` methods.
    -   First parameter is now reference to object itself. Other parameters shifted right.
    -   Change done to be symmetrical with other event APIs.
-   Changed parameters of `CustomTick.onValueChange` method.
    -   First parameter is now reference to object itself. Other parameters shifted right.
    -   Change done to be symmetrical with other event APIs.
-   Changed `PointMarker` API
    -   Removed `setStrokeStyle`, `getStrokeStyle`
    -   Added `setShape`, `getShape`, `setRotation`, `getRotation`
    -   PointMarkers can no longer have borders, but their shape and rotation can be easily changed.
-   Changed default look of cursor PointMarkers
    -   Previously was not visible, now it is a small crosshair
    -   To restore previous look you can either use `chart.setAutoCursor((cursor) => cursor.setPointMarkerVisible(false))` or `theme: { ...Themes.darkGold, cursorPointMarkerFillStyle: emptyFill }`
-   `CursorPoint.series` property name changed to `owner` and type to `unknown`.
-   `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides` visual look changed.
    -   Labels are now next to labels rather than at left/right edges of chart area.
-   Moved `SpiderChart` axis nibs draw order behind series.
    -   This was causing some cursor interaction issues due to the nibs having priority over series

    -   See `Control.translateCoordinate` for newer syntax of coordinate translations
-   Deprecated previous method signature of `solveNearestFromScreen`
    -   New signature was added to replace it. It expects object with { clientX: number, clientY: number } properties, instead of { x: number, y: number }. These values should be proper HTML client coordinates rather than internal LCJS engine coordinates like before.
-   Deprecated `pixelScale` properties.
    -   Use `coordsRelative` property instead, it works exactly same.

-   Added `isThemeDark(Theme)` function to check if selected theme is dark or light
    -   Intended to be used on default library themes only, not custom user themes.
-   Added `EngineSettings.pickingPrecision` for modifying user interactions precision.
    -   This should not be required in normal use cases, but exists just in case.

    -   This event will be triggered when the visibility of an element is actually changed.
-   Added `Hideable` interface.
    -   This interface is implemented by everything that can be hidden with `setVisible`.
-   Added `HideableEvents` interface.
    -   This interface is implemented by everything that has event listeners available for visibility state changes.

### Changed

-   Changed end user APIs that accepted rotations as radians to work with degrees instead:
    -   Data point `rotation` property was previously interpreted as radian, now as degrees
-   ChartXY and Chart3D default interactions now also work over series, instead of just series background
-   Theme interface now requires `isDark` property.
    -   For user defined Themes, you may set this to any value safely. It only interacts with `isThemeDark` convenience function.
-   Improved some default user interactions on trackpad
    -   Affects: ChartXY zoom, Axis zoom, Chart3D zoom
    -   Zooming now responds better according to user interaction behavior (small movement = small effect, etc.)
-   Changed Chart3D zoom animation to be smoother
-   Creating LightningChart component on user supplied DIV no longer overrides `style.position` if it was previously assigned by user
-   Renamed `setHighlighted` -> `setHighlight` and `getHighlighted` -> `getHighlight`
    -   New method now accepts boolean or a number between 0 and 1, meaning that the intensity of highlighting can be configured instead of just being ON/OFF
    -   `getHighlighted()` previously returned Boolean, now `getHighlight()` returns Number
-   Auto cursor now works when mouse is over a series with mouse interactions enabled.
    -   Previously this required user to disable mouse interactions with `series.setMouseInteractions(false)`
-   `onHighlight` parameter can now be `number` or `boolean`. Previously it was always `boolean`.
-   Changed AutoCursor default behavior.
    -   AutoCursor is no longer disabled during Axis Animations (zooming, scrolling) by default
    -   To restore this behavior, use `ChartXY.setAutoCursorEnabledDuringAxisAnimation(false)`
-   Following components default mouse interactions enabled state changes from false to true:
    -   LineSeries, HeatmapSeries, all 3D series
    -   This will not affect performance in any way. By default this will result in these series highlighting when interacted above.
    -   To disable this, use setHighlightOnHover(false)
-   Now axis interactions area expands when axis nibs are disabled.
    -   Axis nibs can be disabled with `axis.setNibInteractionScaleByDragging(false).setNibInteractionScaleByWheeling(false)`
-   Removed `LineStyle.thickness`, please use `LineStyle.getThickness()` instead.
-   `forEachAxis` method now returns `this` instead of `void`
-   UICheckBox 'switch' event is no longer triggered when `setOn()` is called and the state is actually unchanged.
-   Component highlighting is now animated by default.
    -   Animation can be disabled with `setAnimationHighlight(false)`
-   Changed look of LightningChart JS logo that is visible when not using a license.
-   highlighting doesn't touch the alpha channel anymore
-   Changed `LegendBoxAddOptions.disposeOnClick` to `toggleVisibilityOnClick`.
    -   Functionality is also changed to use setVisible internally, rather than dispose
-   Disposing a component can no longer be reverted.
    -   `dispose()` now permanently removes the component.
    -   To temporarily hide a component, use `setVisible(false)` instead
-   Changed default cursor result table formatter of most series types.
    -   Use `series.setCursorResultTableFormatter` method to alter this behavior.
-   Changed default CustomTick type from `UIElementBuilders.PointableTextBox` to `UIElementBuilders.AxisTickMajor`
-   Renamed NewSurfaceGridSeries3D -> SurfaceGridSeries3D, NewSurfaceGridSeries3DOptions -> SurfaceGridSeries3DOptions
-   Changed LegendBox LUTs to not display relative distances between step values. This was done to improve use of space and avoid overlapping labels in cases where LUT steps deltas increase exponentially.
    -   The previous display behavior can be restored with `UILUTCheckBox.setLUTDisplayProportionalSteps` method
-   LegendBoxes are now not draggable by default.
    -   To revert to previous behavior add `legend.setDraggingMode(UIDraggingModes.draggable)` after LB is created.
-   Renamed `Axis.isStopped` to `Axis.getStopped`
-   Slightly altered behavior of `Axis.setInterval` 4th parameter `disableScrolling`
    -   Renamed to `stopAxisAfter`
    -   Before, the method released the Axis unless the `disableScrolling = true`
    -   Now, the method stops the Axis unless `stopAxisAfter = false`
    -   Essentially very similar behavior, but now works a little bit more logically. Usage should not be affected by this change
-   Axis API 'onScaleChange' was changed to 'onIntervalChange' and accepts a callback function with 3 parameters that return axis itself, start and end values
    -   Previous event accepted only 2 parameters, start and end
-   Wrapped parameters of `Axis.setInterval` method in an object
    -   Previous use: `Axis.setInterval(start, end)` -> `Axis.setInterval({ start, end })`
    -   Parameter `disableScrolling` was renamed to `stopAxisAfter` and has a 'true' value by default
-   Library now targets ES6 version instead of ES5.
-   Previously optional `Theme` properties are no longer optional.
    -   `uiTickFont`
    -   `uiTickStrokeStyle`
    -   `uiTickTextFillStyle`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxFont`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxStrokeStyle`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxTextFillStyle`

    -   `surfaceSeriesWireframeStyle`
    -   `resultTableTextFont`
    -   `polarAreaSeriesStrokeStyle`
    -   `polarAreaSeriesFillStyle`
-   Loosened types of `LineStyle` and `emptyLine`. This should not cause any issues with existing applications, but should make it easier to use the library with type safety.
-   ImageFill.sourceMissingColor default value changed from opaque black to completely transparent black.
-   Slightly tweaked default legend, checkbox and lut checkbox style and layout.
-   Changed UI layout behavior (UIElementColumn/UIElementRow)
    -   Before layout was "center oriented", its members were aligned around the entire layouts center.
    -   Now, members are aligned to the start of layout (top for Row and left for Column). This should feel more logical than before.

### Removed

-   `ZoomBandChart` can now be attached to several axis by supplying an array instead of just one axis when it is created.
-   `ZoomBandChart` now automatically aligns its right side according to reference charts.
    -   Previously only left side was aligned.
-   Tweaks to default Axis ticks
    -   In XY charts, ticks that do not fit no longer display their tickline and gridline. Previously, only the label was hidden.
    -   Fixed Numeric major ticks sometimes behaving strange when there is little axis space available. For example, showing 1, 3, 5 instead of 0, 2, 4, 6.
    -   Numeric minor ticks are no longer displayed if the axis is shorter than 50 pixels.
    -   Slightly adjusted the selection of Numeric tick level. Larger tick levels are now activated slightly less eagerly.

-   Fixed `IntensityGrid` and `IntensityMesh` not rendering after restored when using `IndividualPointFill`.
-   Fixed `Axis` event API having some incorrect typings (wheel, drag & touch events) and callback not receiving all arguments.
-   Fixed `HeatmapScrollingGridSeriesIntensityValues` scrolling sometimes behaving strangely (pausing or skipping ahead).
-   Fixed `Axis` animations sometimes not disabled even if chart animations are disabled.
-   Fixed touch events not properly cancelled when touch event goes over OSM.
-   Fixed XY and Polar Axis sometimes rendering incorrectly for 1 frame after window resize.

### Deprecated
